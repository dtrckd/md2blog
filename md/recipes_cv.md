# Tutorials on many image-processing operations

[http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/wksheets.htm](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/wksheets.htm)

A great collection of tutorials on many image-processing operations:

*   [Labeling image pixels](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/analops.htm) — histograms, classification, connected component analysis.

*   [Morphology](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/morops.htm) — dilation, erosion, opening, closing, hit-and-miss transform, thinning, thickening, skeletonization and medial axis transform.

*   [Digital filters and noice reduction](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/filtops.htm) — mean filter, median filter, gaussian smoothing, conservative smoothing, crimmins speckle removal, frequency filters, Laplacian/Laplacian of Gaussian filter (edge detection), unsharp filter.

*   [Feature detectors](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/featops.htm) — Roberts cross edge Detector, Sobel edge detector, Canny edge detector, compass edge detector, zero crossing detector, line detector.

*   [Image transforms](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/tranops.htm) — distance transform, Fourier transform, Hough transform.
